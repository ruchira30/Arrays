# Arrays
### This C program asks the user to enter an array of 5 integer values, stores them in an integer array called `arr`, and then prints the values of the array using a for loop. First, it declares an integer array `arr` of size 100. Then, it prompts the user to enter the values of the array using a for loop that runs 5 times. Inside the for loop, the scanf() function is used to read the integer values entered by the user and store them in the array `arr`. Next, another for loop is used to print the values of the array. Inside the second for loop, printf() function is used to print each value of the array one by one. Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.
