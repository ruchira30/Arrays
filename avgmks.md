# Arrays
### This is a simple C program that calculates the average marks of 30 students. The program uses the standard input/output library header file "stdio.h" for input/output operations. In the main function, variables are declared to store the sum and average of the marks. An integer array 'marks' of size 30 is declared to store the marks of the students.The program then prompts the user to enter the marks of 30 students using the 'printf' function. It then uses a 'for' loop to take input for each student's marks and add them to the 'sum' variable.After taking all the input, the program calculates the average by dividing the sum of marks by the total number of students, which is 30 in this case. Since the 'sum' variable and the divisor are both integers, the result of the division will also be an integer. Therefore, we need to use a float value (30.0) to force floating-point division. The result is then stored in the 'avg' variable.Finally, the program prints the average marks using the 'printf' function with the format specifier "%0.2f" to print the average up to two decimal places.The program then returns 0 to indicate successful completion of the program.
